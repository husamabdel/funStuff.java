/*
Was just bored so i created a quick little game that plays out as a russian roulette, Basically the revolver class
creates an object that takes your name and puts it in the mag function that uses the random object to create a 6 shooter 
revolver. the random object randomly creates a number between 1 and 6 and the bullet is the number 1 so while the 
random number generated by the random object is 1, the name is declared dead and thus looses, a do-while loop was added for 
you to play with your friends.
